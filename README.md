## üöß My contributions to the project
I completely rebuilt the project. [There](https://github.com/basir/react-shopping-cart) is repository from course to compare changes I did.

### üî¥ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) used instead global styles from index.css

The whole project has been rebuilt with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Also I added many of my own styles.  

Instead using library react-reveal to creating animations I created my own animations (I had to do some changes in tailwing.config.js).

### üî¥ Refactored and expanded [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

The structure of the data in Redux was reorganised. I rebuild actions and reducers (I moved business logic of updating state from actions to reducers to make the code cleaner). I used store.subscribe() to save part of state in localStorage and used it to initialize store.

### üî¥ I rebuild whole project using functional components

Project from course was created using class components. I used functional components and hooks to rebuilt the project. I used hooks: useState, useEffect, useDispatch, useSelector.

### üî¥ I built smaller components and used [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) 

Instead building the whole project using only 4 components I split the code into smaller components. Also I reorganized components structure using Atomic Design

### üî¥ I built my own modal component

I didn't use library react-modal. I created my own reusable modal component. I used redux to open and close modals.

### üî¥ I expanded backend app

In the course was shown minimalistic backend server. I improved it. I created and moved controllers, models, routes into separated folders. I prepared structure to develop the app.   

Also I upgrated librares so I have to do some breaking changes (I didn't use deprecated bodyparser, I changed calling mongoose.connect())

## Installation
1. To run the project locally firstly you have to install [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and run it. You can also install [Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/install/) to visualize data in database and use for example [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to load products data into the MongoDB.

On Mac to start Mongo DB type in terminal windows
```
mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

mongo
```

2. Clone this repository
3. In the command line type `npm install` in the project root folder
4. Then `npm run server` to start the backend app
5. In second terminal window type `npm start` to start the frontend app

You have to create POST request in Postman to address: `http://localhost:5000/api/products`. In the body section check raw and select JSON. Then copy example object from postman.json and press Send.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Code example


- ### Modal
I created reusible Modal component

#### `Modal.jsx:`
```
export default function Modal({ onCloseModal, children, isOpen }) {
  if (!isOpen) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-70 ">
      <div className="absolute left-10 top-32 right-10 border bg-white overflow-auto rounded p-5 pb-20 animate-pop-up lg:inset-x-20 lg:inset-y-20">
        <button
          className="absolute right-6 top-6 border border-gray-500 rounded-sm px-2 py-0 bg-gray-100 hover:border-gray-900  "
          onClick={onCloseModal}
        >
          x
        </button>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
#### `Usage of <Modal/> component`

```
<Modal isOpen={isOrderDetailOpen} onCloseModal={handleCloseModal}>
      {/* sd */}      
</Modal>
```
